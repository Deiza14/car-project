          <h6><b>Bio Golf 5 R32</b></h6>
        <p>After the IV R32 set the tone for where the brand was going, Volkswagen launched the Golf V R32 in 2005 which became the most powerful and fastest production Golf at the time. The Volkswagen Golf V R32 is based on the standard Golf, meaning its design and dimensions are near identical. However, its new nose design and lowered suspension mean there are small differences such as a 20 mm height reduction and length increase of 42 mm. The next second edition R32 followed the successful formula laid down by the previous R32 and in doing so, established itself at the top of the Golf range, above the already highly acclaimed GTI.</p>
